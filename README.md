# My Mondo
Built during [MondoHack 3](https://attending.io/events/mondohack-3)

[Mondo](https://getmondo.co.uk) are awesome however they don't have an android app. I've made a clone of their iOS app as a webapp which you can use on any device and can be pinned to your home screen to look + act exactly like their app.

# Deploying Disclaimer
Mondo don't allow customers to log into your app yet, so you're going to have to host the app yourself with your app credentials for it to work. I'm also re-authenticating on every request and not bothering with storing anything in a database to make things simple until they decide to open up the API to third parties logging into your apps.
